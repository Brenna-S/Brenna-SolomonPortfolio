      <p class="para1"> Hi my name is Brenna Solomon a 22 year old Software Engineer. I have obtained an associates degree in Business Administration 
        and now a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. I have always been very fascinated with the technology world ever since I was a kid.
        Whether I was taking computers apart and putting them back together, or replacing parts, or even designing my own personal projects, the love and passion for this
        field started at what feels like the beginning of time.

        I have managed to maneuver life as a first generation American living in a single parent immigrant household.
        The drive and motivation I have for success is unmatched.

        I have developed and molded my business for the past 3 years and I'm excited for the journey that comes.
